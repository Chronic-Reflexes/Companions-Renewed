Updated the resource to work with 1.21.8
Companions Renewed currently is only built against 1.21.8, and I've removed multi version support
other versions haven't been tested and are not guaranteed to work.

Everything I've tested so far appears to be in working order, If you come across any bugs, please report them and ill try working on it in my spare time

Current focus of the project is to fix any bugs that come up with updating to a newer Minecraft version
Then make the plugin work with future updates of Minecraft
i may backport to popular/major previous Minecraft versions but cannot guarantee the success

Then ill maybe make some additions based off of feature requests
